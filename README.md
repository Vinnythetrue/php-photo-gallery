# PHP Photo Gallery
**Beamtic PHP Gallery** takes advantage of PHP's build-in capabilities and [file-handling](https://beamtic.com/files-and-directories-php) to create a modern image gallery, allowing us to create categories, upload images, and organize them into categories.

There is a live demo available at the website.

## Installation
Installing the photo gallery is simple. You can either download a **.7z** file from the project website ([phpphotogallery.com](https://phpphotogallery.com/)), or you can clone this git repository.

After extracting the zip and moving the files to your server, you just need to add the usual permissions with **chmod**. _*I.e:* chmod 777 /var/www/mysite/gallery_
